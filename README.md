work done for school
Worked through the Python for Everybody textbook by Charles Severance, included is coursework.
The file marked PIL-Tesseract-OpenCV is the final for the course he taught after python for everyone. All this work was done and saved in the 
open source Runstone Textbook, this file being the exception. This script will accept a picture of a newspaper sheet, use OCR to convert all 
the text to a string. Then it will search for a given name, if found it will display a contact sheet of all the face found in the image with the 
found name.
